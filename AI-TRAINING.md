# AI Training Terms

If you use this code or any derivative works to train artificial intelligence models,
machine learning systems, or large language models (LLMs), you agree to the following terms:

## Requirements for AI Training Use

1. **Model Release**: You must release the trained model weights publicly under an
   open source license compatible with the AGPL-3.0.

2. **Training Data**: You must release the complete training dataset publicly under
   an open source license or public domain dedication.

3. **Documentation**: You must provide clear documentation of:
   - How this code was used in the training process
   - Any modifications made to this code
   - The architecture and configuration of the trained model

4. **Attribution**: You must clearly attribute this project in any publications,
   documentation, or distributions of the trained model.

## Rationale

This requirement ensures that if this free and open source code contributes to
training AI systems, those systems and their training data remain free and open
to the community. This aligns with the copyleft principles of the AGPL-3.0 license.

## Enforcement

These terms are a condition of use separate from the AGPL-3.0 license. Violation
of these terms constitutes a breach of the copyright license granted for AI training
purposes.

## Questions

If you have questions about these terms or wish to discuss alternative arrangements,
please open an issue in the project repository.
